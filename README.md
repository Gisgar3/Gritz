# Gritz
The computer diagnostic program created for Windows.

### Information  
**Gritz** is a Windows program that was developed for the sole-purpose of diagnosing problems and finding information of a computer.
The original idea of **Gritz** stemmed from the time when I helped my aunt fix her computer after being phished online; I figured there could be an easier way of finding a lot of hardware information quicker and more efficiently.  
**Gritz** was originally intended to be a side-project that would only be used by me, but I figured that it could be helpful for others too.
